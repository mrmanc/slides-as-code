# Slides As Code

Note:
  One thing: publish first Jekyll site

Structure

* Why
* How
* What

Note: Split into three parts  
  Why, how, what

# Why…

Slides about slides?

Note: Very meta  
  Asked about slides a few times

--

I ❤ simple slides

Note: Shouldn’t distract from content  
  https://speaking.io/

--

Presenting / teaching

Note: Presented, teaching apprentices

--

Problem: maintaining content

--

Slides, notes, code spread around

--

Permissions

Note: Google Drive folders  
  Need permission to edit, mysterious  
  Not versioned  
  Fear to edit  
  New files each year  

--

Slides should be easy to change

Note: Think as I build  
  Editing is time-consuming  

--

Powerpoint vs Keynote

Note: Powerpoint sucks  
  Keynote sucks less  
  But Mac / PC  

--

Publish publicly (for free)

Note: Speakerdeck  
  Workflow to publish after changing  

---

# How?

Note: How can we solve that problem?

--

Already use Jekyll & GitHub Pages

Note: Blog, manual, anything

--

Coders ❤ GitHub

--

Coders ❤ Code

--

reveal.js

--

Combine Jekyll & reveal.js?

--

* **reveal.js**  
  presents slides from text, e.g.
  ```markdown
  * Bullet <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  ```
+ **jekyll-revealjs (remote Jekyll theme)**  
  provides & configures reveal.js, converts markdown to reveal.js text, e.g.  
  ```markdown
  + Bullet
  ```
+ **Jekyll**  
  preprocessor which converts markdown into HTML
+ **GitHub Pages**  
  runs Jekyll on your code and publishes results

--

Docker so you don’t have to install Jekyll

--

Confused? Don’t worry…

--

Starter project to the rescue!

--

Just add your markdown, push, publish

---

# What…

Note: Practical time  

--

Install Docker

https://docs.docker.com/install/

--

Clone:

https://github.atcloud.io/AutoTrader/jekyll-revealjs-starter

(name it something like ‘my-slides’)

--

Serve site locally & hit http://localhost:4000/

```shell
docker-compose up
```

--

Change in `_posts/0000-01-01-welcome.md` and hit reload

Note: Headings  
  Fragments  
  Background colour  
  Background images  
  Speaker notes  
  

--

Create a personal GitHub repo (e.g. ‘my-slides’)

--

```shell
git remote add origin https://github.com/…
```

--

Push your changes

--

Go to your repository’s settings page

* Find ‘GitHub Pages’
* Set ‘Source’ to ‘master branch’ and ‘Save’
* Hit refresh until ‘Your site is published at https://github…’

Your site is published

--

Works on github.com and GitHub Enterprise

--

github.com supports custom domain names

(even using HTTPS)

Note: Free hosting  

--

Add slide link to repository

---

## How does it work?

--

Cloned site contains `_config.yml` file

--

`_config.yml` tells Jekyll to use a remote theme

--

Jekyll pull theme from public GitHub

--

Theme contains file which transforms posts into one HTML page

---

## Possibilities?

--

Site doesn’t have to be on master

--

GitHub pages source can be:

* `gh-pages` branch
* `master` branch
* `master` branch `/docs` folder

--

Site documentation in project repo?

--

Tutorial slides and Java exercises in same repo?

https://github.atcloud.io/AutoTrader/tutorial-template

[Boot camp slides and exercises](https://github.com/MCR-Digital/apprentice-boot-camp-fundamentals-1)

--

Personal site?

http://markcrossfield.co.uk/

--

Hobby site?

---

## Summary

+ Using code to make slides easy to build and version
+ Combining reveal.js, Jekyll, GitHub Pages to publish for free
+ Created your own set of slides as code
+ Go forth and present!
