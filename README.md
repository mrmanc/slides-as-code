# jekyll-reveal-starter

A starter project to get you going with a presentation described using markdown.

## Why?

* Markdown is easier than Powerpoint
* You can version them nicely
* Very portable
* You can put code in the same repo

## How?

Clone this repo, change files in the `_posts` directory and run `docker-compose up`. Push to a new GitHub repo and in its settings use ‘master’ as the GitHub Pages source.
